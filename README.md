#Word Press - React 
--- 
Just messing around with using WordPress CMS as a backend with a react front end. 

If you want to mess around, you can go into the theme's root folder and install the node modules with the ```npm install``` command. 

```npm run dev``` will run the development settings
```npm run production``` will minimize and uglify app
